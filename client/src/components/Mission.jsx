                            <p>
                            Our mission is to address food insecurity and hunger by providing a platform that connects food donors with victims in need. 
                            We aim to make it easy for people to donate food, as well as monetary donations.
                             Our goal is to create a community of generosity and compassion, where those who have excess food can share it with those who are struggling to put food on the table. 
                             We believe that everyone deserves access to nutritious food, and we are committed to helping bridge the gap between those who have and those who need 
                             and making that a reality by leveraging technology to help solve this issue.
                             Our vision is a world where hunger is no longer a barrier to human potential and well-being.
